BITS = 4
BASE = HEX

# hash '#' starts a comment line
# comment lines are skipped 
# empty lines are skipped
# data are separated by spaces
# the base can be 'BIN', 'DEC', or 'HEX'
# the default is 'HEX'
# each word read is coerced to 'BITS' length

# EXAMPLES:

# % HEX
# FF FE 00 01

# % BIN
# 11111111 11111110 00000000 00000001
