# forewords

The simsys package is a first attempt at helping building a computer logic from scratch.
The focus is based on reliability more than speed.
It is to be added to the development of brickworks.
The code will remain fairly simple (if slow) for easy debugging.
The only output so far is a VCD file which records every port values and transitions
The VCD file can easily be displayed using GTKwave (available on many platforms)
Optimisation should come last but should preserve code clarity: it is meant for development, not for productivity
